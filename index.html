    <h1>My Summer in South Korea</h1>
    <p>Hello!

My name is Benjamin Sutton and I am here to tell you about my summer to Seoul, South Korea with the University of Michigan, School of Information. This is my second trip to Korea actually with the first trip being for vacation in 2015 for Christmas. On that trip I only got to spend 24 hours in Seoul so this trip was a lot more fun time spent in the city. You will see this trip through the foods I ate, the places I visited, and the people (and their dogs) I got to meet. This trip was an amazing experience and I hope you gain some more information that is the great city of Seoul, and the country of South Korea.

Enjoy!

    <h2>Places</h2>
    <p>
      I loved visiting all the landmarks in Seoul. It was so great to just explore and find places that are hidden and special as well as the main tourist spots too. I also went to the DMZ which was a really great experience and very eye opening to what the country went through in the Korean War.

      <h2>People(and Dogs)</h2>
      <p>
      This is a selection of some of the people who let me take their pictures and of several of the dogs I got to meet. I am a very people oriented person and love meeting new people, so this trip allowed me to do that everyday with my travels. I also got to meet a lot of their dogs while I was walking around the city and you will see that the dogs were very nice and liked getting their pictures taken!

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>
          The food in Korea was absolutely amazing and a reason I will want to go back for sure. Seoul is such a great food city where you are constantly finding new places to eat and explore. My favorite dishes were Bibimbop and Bugolgi but also there were lots of other ethnic dishes from other countries I had which were amazing.
